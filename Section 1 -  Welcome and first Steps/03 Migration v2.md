Migration Guide to v2
🚨 If you just bought this course and are looking at it for the first time, then please skip this lecture 😃



👉 But if you bought the older version of this course and already watched it, then here is all the information about this new course version!



[01] How do I access the old course?

The old course is available for download at the end of the course (Section 11), in the section called [LEGACY] Old Course Version 1. Downloads include all videos and English captions. Scroll to the end of the course to learn more 😉

Also, until the end of August 2021, I will leave the old course at the end of this course, so you can finish watching the old course if you want. After that, the old sections will be deactivated. There is no way around this.

I strongly advise you to just drop the old course and jump straight into version 2! The guide below will help you with that, so keep reading 👇



[02] What is new in version 2?

This new course version:

Has 35+ (!!!) hours of new video

Is modern from the beginning, with a strong focus on flexbox and even CSS Grid

Has more, better, and more beautiful projects (wait for the new Omnifood 😍)

Has a bigger focus on web design, with an easy-to-apply design framework I developed specifically for this course

Has more opportunities to practice, by coding multiple challenges, components, and projects

Has better and deeper explanations of every single topic

Has better and more theory videos, so that you can master the foundations of HTML and CSS!



[03] Should I watch the new course?

Let's see different situations:

👉 If you haven't started the old Omnifood project yet (Old Section 5), drop the course immediately and move on to the new course version

👉 If you are in the middle of the old Omnifood project, you can still finish it, and then watch the entire new course. That's because it contains completely different techniques, such as flexbox and CSS Grid

👉 If you already completed the entire old course and only want to watch what's new, you should check out Section 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (and maybe 9).

👉 Not sure? Just watch the whole new course 😎



[04] What about my course progress?

Unfortunately, your progress has been reset by all this new material 😢

But look at the bright side, you just got a new 35-hour course 100% for free 🤩

So, just watch the new content to bring you up-to-date, according to the information in point 3). Then, simply mark the rest of the videos that you didn't watch as completed. I know, that's not super fun to do, but it will only take you 5 minutes. Again, it's hopefully worth it for the huge upgrade you got.



[05] What about my notes?

Unfortunately, your notes will disappear together with the old course videos 😢

However, there is an easy way of downloading notes, created by one of my students. Check out this repository, and just follow the instructions folder.



[06] Feedback

If your opinion of the course has changed after this update, then please update your review ⭐️ to reflect that. Maybe you previously commented that the course was outdated? Well, not anymore :)

I would really appreciate it!

And now, have fun with your new course! ✌️
