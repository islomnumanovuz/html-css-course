Hello, and welcome to your brand new course,

build responsive real-world websites with HTML and CSS.

And if this is your very first contact

with any coding of HTML or CSS,

then let me also welcome you

to the exciting world of web development.

I'm sure that you're gonna love it.

Now as the name of the course says,

this course is all about using the languages of HTML and CSS

to build beautiful, responsive, and also real world website.

And so this course basically covers four big topics,

web design, HTML, and CSS, of course,

and responsive design.

And this course is in my opinion,

the very best way of learning all this

that you will find anywhere.

And so really you have come to the right place here.

Now, before we start learning,

let's take a couple of minutes to get a quick overview

of how the course is organized and structured,

and also the projects that we're going to build together.

So basically that, you know exactly

how this course is gonna work.

So this course is divided into nine sections

with a total of 35 hours of video content.

And it starts right here in section one

where you will get a high-level overview

of web development general, and it will also build

your very fast, but extremely simple webpage,

just to get you excited for what's ahead.

Then in section two, we're gonna move

to the very basics of the HTML language

by building a small project,

to give you a solid foundation for the rest of the course.

After that in section number three,

you're gonna learn the foundations of CSS.

So things like styling text, the CSS box model,

and sizing and positioning elements.

And we will even talk about some developer skills

such as reading documentation and debugging.

Moving on, section number four is all about

building layouts using CSS.

So basically it's about how to arrange elements

on the page in a logical way.

And we can do that in multiple ways in CSS.

And so we will learn all of them,

but actually focus more on modern technologies

called Flexbox and CSS grid.

Then in section five,

we take a small break from web development

and move on to web design.

And this is actually a really special section,

which could infact be an entire course on its own.

So here I teach you countless easy to use design rules

and design guidelines,

so that you can not only build interfaces,

but also know how to make them beautiful

and professional looking.

And there are actually not many people

who are good at development and design at the same time.

And so this part of the course

is gonna be a great opportunity for you.

Next up is section six,

where we will learn all about common website components

and common layout patterns that many websites out there use,

so that then you can build your own websites in the future

using these patterns too.

And we will do this by looking at a ton of examples

and also by building some components

with HTML and CSS ourselves.

Finally, section seven, eight, and nine

are all about building or big course project,

which is called Omnifood.

So here we will finally build that beautiful, responsive

and real world website that this course is all about.

And to do this, you're gonna use all the skills

that you have accumulated up until this point.

And of course also learn a lot of new stuff

such as how to plan and sketch a website,

how to make it responsive

and really how to handle such a big project

from start to finish.

So just look at this beautiful project right here.

By the end of the course,

you will be able to design and build

something just like this on your own.

And that is just amazing, right?

Now, besides all this,

there are also many coding challenges

and also other opportunities

for you to practice the HTML and CSS skills

that you keep acquiring over the course of this course

because practicing is actually

the single most important thing

that you really need to do in order to learn coding.

All right, so I hope that you're gonna have a ton of fun

with this course now that you'll become

ready to build your own websites

and that you will have a successful start

into your web development career.

And with that being said,

let's now finally get started.
