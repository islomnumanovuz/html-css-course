Now, one of the things that you need

in order to go through this course is

to get access to some starter files

for each of the sections in this course.

And so in this video,

let me very quickly show you

how you can access those files.

So the entire starter files,

as well as the final files for each

of the sections of the course

are hosted in this so-called repository on GitHub.

And GitHub is basically a code platform

where most developers upload their code to,

in order to share it or to collaborate

with other developers or simply to store it.

So a repository is basically a folder

which contains a bunch of code or other files.

And each repository can be accessed by a URL

and this repository is available on this, URL here.

But don't worry, you don't have to type that in.

So I included this link in this lecture on Udemy,

and it should also be in the very first text lecture

of this section.

So I'm sure that you can find this link here,

so this URL, somewhere in this lecture.

So just click that and then you will end up

on this exact same repository.

So in this repository, as I mentioned,

we have all the starter files

and for each of the sections of the course,

there is 1 folder.

For example, the next section,

which are the HTML Fundamentals,

contains all of these images and also this text document.

Okay, I also included the final code

for each of the sections,

so that you can always compare your own code

to the code that I'm writing in the videos.

And this will be very important,

so that you can compare your code to mine

in case that you have any mistakes in your code.

So comparing your code to mine, like this,

will always be your easiest way of finding mistakes,

so of finding errors that you are maybe typing in your code

and that will happen for sure.

It happens to all beginners.

And so in that situation,

you can just get access to the final code.

Finally, down here, there is also this written document,

which contains these most frequently asked questions.

So before actually starting the course,

it might be a good idea to quickly read

through these questions.

That should only take you like 3 minutes,

but I'm sure it will help you clear some doubts

that you might get as you go through the course.

But anyway, what we really came here to

is to actually get access to the code, right?

And so to download this code,

all we have to do is to click here on this green button

and then down here choosing the download zip option.

And now this should probably take some time

because there are a lot of images here.

And so let's just wait for this download to finish.

Okay, and that download just finished.

Now let's go back to the desktop

or wherever you are working.

And then let's simply put

those files that we just downloaded there.

All right, so then we need to extract this zip archive

and on a Mac,

you just have to double click that file

and on Windows,

you just right click and then extract all.

Okay, so we don't need that anymore.

And now let's quickly open up this folder,

just so we can see that it is indeed

the exact same files that we just saw on GitHub.

So we have the starter files

and here, the files for the next section,

and then also the final files.

And so now with these starter files in place,

we are actually ready to start learning HTML

in the next section.
