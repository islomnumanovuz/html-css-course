Welcome to the first big section of the course.

So, in this section, we will learn the fundamental language

of web development, which is HTML.

And we're gonna learn HTML by building

a very small example project where you will learn

all about the most important HTML elements.

So, for things like creating headings, paragraphs,

lists, images, links, and more.

Okay, so let's go start this journey right now.
