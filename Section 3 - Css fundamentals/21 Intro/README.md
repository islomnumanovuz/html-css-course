So you learnt the basics of HTML in the last section.

And so now it's time to learn the basics

of the second language of the web, and that is CSS.

Now, CSS is essentially all about styling the content

that we write in HTML.

And so in this section, we will keep building

our project and basically add some visual styles to it.

We will also learn some theoretical concepts

that are behind CSS,

so that you actually understand how CSS works.

And this is really important

because then, once you start writing your own code,

you will actually know what you're doing.

So I hope all that sounds really exciting,

and so let's get started.
